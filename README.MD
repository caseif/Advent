# Advent

Advent is a custom Bukkit plugin designed to facilitate the distribution of Advent calendar-style gifts. Admins may
create Advent chests, which players may then claim. Each day of Advent, a pre-configured gift will be added to each
chest. On Christmas, multiple gifts may be defined.

To create an Advent chest, create a sign and set the top line to `[Advent]`.

**Disclaimer:** This was written almost three years ago, shortly after I first began learning Java. As such, the code
is likely to be pretty terrible. I can guarantee it will work perfectly on Minecraft 1.4, but no promises for anything
past that.

This software is released as public domain. You may do what you wish with it (except plagiarize it, because that isn't
cool).
